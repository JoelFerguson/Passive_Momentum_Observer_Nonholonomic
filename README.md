# Passive_Momentum_Observer_Nonholonomic
Simulation code for the paper 'Passive momentum observer for nonholonomic systems'

The observer without additional input term can be simulated using the script 'chaplyginSim_obs.m'. The combined energy plot in figure 5 is reproduced by calling 'plotCombinedEnergy.m'

The control example is simulated calling the script 'chaplyginSim_ctrl.m'.
